# Machine learning

Build projects supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and neural networks), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, Anomaly Detection and recommender systems), Reinforcement Learning and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
