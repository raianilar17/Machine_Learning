# Machine learning

Designed and implemented projects across a broad range of machine learning domains, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and recommender systems), and reinforcement learning.

Adopted industry best practices inspired by leading AI and ML innovations in Silicon Valley, including:
- Rigorous model **evaluation and hyperparameter tuning** for performance optimization.
- Emphasis on a **data-centric approach** to enhance model accuracy and generalization.
- Exposure to **end-to-end ML workflows** with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and real-world applicability.
