Visualizing example dataset for PCA.

Program paused. Press enter to continue.

Running PCA on example dataset.

Top eigenvector:
 U(:,1) = -0.707107 -0.707107

(you should expect to see -0.707107 -0.707107)

Dimension reduction on example dataset.

Projection of the first example: 1.481274

(this value should be about 1.481274)

Approximation of the first example: -1.047419 -1.047419

(this value should be about  -1.047419 -1.047419)
